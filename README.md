## Dynamic Image and Data Analysis (DynamicsAnalysisPipeline)
The dynamics pipeline performs image and statistical analysis of single-molecule dynamic images. This includes conversion to TIFF, background subtraction, tracking, puncta characterization, and plotting. More details inside the folder "DynamicsAnalysisPipeline."

## Staining Analysis (StainingAnalysisPipeline)
The staining pipeline performs image and statistical analysis of staining images. This includes conversion to TIFF, background subtraction, segmentation, extraction of nuclear and cytosolic intensities, and plotting.
